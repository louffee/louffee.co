# Iconography

The iconography system is a set of icons that are used to represent actions, 
objects, and concepts in a visual way. They are used to help users understand 
the content and functionality of a product.

Internally, we use the icons from the [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/icons)
library.

<IconGallery>
  {Object.keys(icons).map((iconName) => (
    <IconItem key={iconName} name={iconName}>
      <Icon name={iconName} width={24} height={24} className="text-black" />
    </IconItem>
  ))}
</IconGallery>
