# Spinner

<GitHubRepoPath path="packages/ui/src/spinner/spinner.tsx" />

A spinner component is used to indicate that a page or component is loading. It
is recommended to use a spinner when a skeleton loading state is not possible or
too complex to implement or be understood by the user.

## Usage

```tsx
<Spinner className="text-rose-800" />
```

The spinner component can be customized by passing a class name to the 
component.

<div className="flex items-center justify-center gap-3">
  <Spinner className="text-rose-800" />
</div>
