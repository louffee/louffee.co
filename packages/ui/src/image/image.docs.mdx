The image component is a wrapper around the native Next.js Image component API. 
It provides a way to lazy load images and display a placeholder while the image 
is loading. It also provides a way to display a blur-up effect while the image
is loading.

## Usage

```tsx
import Image from '@louffee/ui/image'

<Image 
  src="/assets/logo.svg" 
  alt="Image description" 
  width={300} 
  height={300}
/>
```

<Image 
  src="/assets/logo.svg" 
  alt="Image description" 
  width={300} 
  height={300}
/>
