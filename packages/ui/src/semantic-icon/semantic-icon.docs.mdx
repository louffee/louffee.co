# SemanticIcon

The semantic icon is a component that displays an icon based on its meaning. In
technical and practical terms, this component only wraps an `Icon` component
passed as `children`, adding a flexbox layout and applying height and width 
based on the calculated size of the icon.

The `height` and `width` props are accepted. They're both forwarded to the inner
SVG element in corner cases in which the necessity of overriding the default
pre-calculated size arises.

However, in common cases, the `height` and `width` props are not necessary, as
the component will calculate the size based on the given `size` prop.

## Usage

To understand how the `SemanticIcon` acts, let's take a look at the JSX of the
`DangerIcon` component:

```tsx
<SemanticIcon size="xl" className="bg-zinc-200/30 text-red-600 dark:text-red-400">
  <Icon name="ExclamationTriangle" />
</SemanticIcon>
```

By default, as the `SemanticIcon` only accepts `Icon` as children, it will set
and render the `Icon` component with the `name` prop passed to it. Also, the
`size` can be replicated as the one exported by the `Icon` component props and
utilised to calculate the size of the icon automatically.

Therefore, the 
component won't require much customization in most cases, leaving its 
enhancement to the class names. For instance, the combination of the `Icon` and 
`SemanticIcon` and the class names in the example above will result in the same
HTML as the `DangerIcon`. See below:

<div className="flex justify-center">
  <DangerIcon size="xl" />
</div>
