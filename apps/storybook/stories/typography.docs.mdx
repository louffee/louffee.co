# Typography

Our typography is designed to be clear and easy to read. We use a combination of
serif and sans-serif fonts to create a clear hierarchy and to make the reading
experience more enjoyable. We also use variations of the _lead_, _muted_, 
etcetera. This typography system is heavily based on the typography styles 
provided by [**shadcn/ui**](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/typography).

**Font families:** **Playfair Display** for the heading of level 1 and **Inter** 
for the other headings, paragraph, blockquotes, and any other texts.

The font [**Playfair Display**](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display) 
is a serif which is used for the heading of level 1 to create a clear hierarchy 
and to make the reading experience more enjoyable and easy. Meanwhile, The font 
[**Inter**](https://rsms.me/inter/) is a sans-serif which is used for the other 
headings, paragraph, blockquotes, and any other texts. It is designed to be 
clear and easy to read as well.
