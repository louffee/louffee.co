As we make everything we do clear and visible, we have the whole project
open-sourced in this [repository](https://github.com/louffee/louffee.co).

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.29. [Bun](https://bun.sh)
is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.

## Technologies ðŸ‘·

Below, we list a few of the amazing projects and technologies that we use under
the hood to power the front- and backbone of our products so you can take a look
and support them.

- ![TypeScript Logo](./_/docs/assets/brands/typescript-18x18.svg)
  [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org) is a superset of JavaScript developed
  by Microsoft, introducing a statically type system to enhance productivity and
  assertiveness of the codebase. See the repository on GitHub by clicking
  [here](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript).
- ![React Logo](./_/docs/assets/brands/react-18x18.svg)
  [ReactJS](https://react.dev) is the most famous and popular UI (user
  interface) library out there, built and maintained by Meta with one of the
  best community ever. See the repository on GitHub by clicking
  [here](https://github.com/facebook/react).
- ![Next.js Logo](./_/docs/assets/brands/nextjs-18x18.svg)
  [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) is *the* React Framework that combines both
  server- and client-side and makes great applications such as
  [Cal.com](https://cal.com) and many others come to life!
- ![Radix UI Logo](./_/docs/assets/brands/radix-ui-18x18.svg)
  [Radix UI](https://radix-ui.com) is a fantastic primitive component with
  behaviours of components built-in and distribute them so we can use amazing
  components such as the Tooltip, Slot, Popover, and many others. Seriously,
  it's incredible. See the repository on GitHub by clicking
  [here](https://github.com/radix-ui/primitives). Also, the Radix Team created
  one of the most beautiful iconography library and we also use it ðŸ˜Š.
- ![TailwindCSS Logo](./_/docs/assets/brands/tailwindcss-18x18.svg)
  [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) is the top-notch library when we talk
  about styling. It provides an amazing API and several utility classes that
  work together to provide a developer experience as smooth as possible. Also,
  by extending some plugins such as the
  [tailwind-variants](https://tailwind-variants.com),
  [tailwind-merge](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge),
  [tailwind-animate](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/tailwindcss-animate) and
  many others; this simplistic PostCSS plugin becomes a nice friend to have
  around.
- ![shadcn/ui Logo](./_/docs/assets/brands/shadcn-ui-18x18.svg)
  [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) is "NOT a component library. It's a
  collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your
  apps." That's how shadcn/ui's defines what the shadcn/ui is. So I think it's
  safe to say they're an "anti-library," and it's fabulous. See their GitHub
  repository by clicking [here](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui).
- ![Storybook Logo](./_/docs/assets/brands/storybook-18x18.svg)
  [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) is a great tool to test and validate
  UI components by putting them in a playground. We can create documentations
  and use it to emulate a lot of situations thanks to the Storybook community,
  such as telling Storybook to simulate a Next.js app, which is crazy and
  awesome. See the repository on GitHub by clicking
  [here](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook).
- ![Testing Library Logo](./_/docs/assets/brands/testing-library-18x18.svg)
  [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com) is an extension which can adapt
  to most of the test runners out there and it helps us test our JSX and React
  components by providing a testing DOM extension with a great API to validate
  things on the HTML markup! See the repository on GitHub by clicking
  [here](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library).
- ![Bun Logo](./_/docs/assets/brands/bun-18x18.svg) [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a
  blazing fast JavaScript runtime which runs on top of the
  [JavaScriptCore](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/javascriptcore) by
  Apple to provide maximum performance and still be compatible with most of the
  [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org) APIs. We're using Bun to handle the server-side
  things that Louffee needs and also to control our dependencies and workspace
  system to make sure this monorepo work like a charm. See the repository on
  GitHub by clicking [here](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun).
- ![Turborepo Logo](./_/docs/assets/brands/turborepo-18x18.svg)
  [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) is a great tool developed by Vercel to
  manage build and other processes that a monorepo needs. As it is written in
  Rust, Turborepo is fast, reliable, and combines with a nice cache system from
  Vercel Cloud's infrastructure to allow rapid build times. See the repository
  on GitHub by clicking [here](https://github.com/vercel/turbo).
- ![BiomeJS Logo](./_/docs/assets/brands/biome-18x18.svg)
  [BiomeJS](https://biomejs.dev) is a formatter and linter which is still in its
  first steps, but as we believe that this is a great tool and will evolve even
  more, we're supporting it the best way we can, **by using it :D**. See the
  repository on GitHub by clicking [here](https://github.com/biomejs/biome).
- ![SemVer Logo](./_/docs/assets/brands/semver-18x18.svg)
  [SemVer](https://semver.org) is a convention used to solve problems when it
  comes to versioning software. It defines the major, minor, and patch,
  providing the context for them to update. It works like a charm when a tool
  to update it automatically.
- ![Vercel Logo](./_/docs/assets/brands/vercel-18x18.svg)
  [Vercel](https://vercel.com) is the Frontend Cloud. We use to make sure that
  Louffee is up and running with the best performance possible. Despite being
  created for the frontend, Vercel is also amazing at managing scalability and
  provision of backend services and edge applications. Oh, yeah, they also
  created both Turborepo and Next.js.
