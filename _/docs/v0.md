# V0

[v0](https://v0.dev) is an artificial intelligence (AI) tool developed and
maintained by [Vercel](https://vercel.com) that helps us develop quicker user
interfaces (UI) by generating portions of a screen or a screen with
[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [React](https://react.dev)
components.

We can break down the generate UI and replace the inline-styled elements with
the components from our design system to provide a cohesive and smooth user
experience (UX) throughout the whole application.

In this document, we register which of the organisms and/or pages are initially
created with the v0 engine.
